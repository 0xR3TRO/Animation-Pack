## Project Description

### Objective:

The "Animated Product Description" project aims to provide users with a tool for creating dynamic, animated product descriptions for websites. The application allows for the creation of visually appealing product presentations that can increase customer engagement and improve conversions on e-commerce sites.

### Features Description:

- **Animation Creation:** Users can create animated product descriptions using various effects such as movement, color changes, inserting graphics, and text.
- **Customization:** Ability to customize animations, including duration, style, and transition effects.
- **Resource Library:** Access to a gallery of graphics, icons, and templates for use in animations.
- **CMS Integration:** Easy integration with popular Content Management Systems (CMS) such as WordPress, Joomla, etc.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Animation Creation:** Users can select various animation effects, insert texts, and graphics.
- **Customization:** Access to tools for customizing animation details such as duration, colors, and special effects.
- **Resource Library:** The application offers graphic resources and animation templates.
- **CMS Integration:** Enable easy integration with Content Management Systems.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- **Performance:** The application should operate smoothly, ensuring quick creation and display of animations.
- **Usability:** Intuitive user interface that does not require advanced technical knowledge.
- **Compatibility:** Animations should work across different browsers and devices.

## Interface Design:

### Sketches/Visualizations of the Interface:

- _Home Page:_ Control panel with options for creating animations, accessing the resource library, and CMS integration.
- _Animation Creation Window:_ Area for designing animations, selecting effects, and previewing.
- _Resource Library:_ Browsing available graphics, icons, and templates.

### Site Map:

- _Home Page_
  - Control Panel
  - Animation Creation Options
  - Resource Library
- _Animation Creation Window_
  - Animation Effects
  - Animation Preview
- _Resource Library_
  - List of Available Resources
  - Ability to Add Custom Resources

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores data of product animations, including:

- **Animation Parameters:** Contains information about the user-selected effects.
- **Resources:** Stores graphics, icons, and animation templates.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on an MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure where:

- **Model:** Responsible for animation logic and resource management.
- **View:** Presents the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages communication between the model and the view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) for data management and application logic.
- **Database:** SQLite (stores data about animations and resources).

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Separate files for animation logic, interface, and data management.
- _Coding Style:_ Use of modularity, readability, and comments in the code.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Checking the correctness of animation and customization functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensuring that components work together correctly.
- **User Interface Tests:** Checking user interactions on different devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Evaluating the performance of creating and displaying animations.

### Testing Procedures:

- Developing a set of test cases for each application function.
- Establishing procedures for reporting and fixing found bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, fixing, and publishing on platforms accessible to users.
- **Deadlines:** Setting dates for planned stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establishing communication channels for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Planning regular updates based on needs and user feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Division of work into specific tasks (e.g., implementing the animation creator, interface, testing).
- **Deadlines:** Determining the time required for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on hours of work or a team of developers.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, potential fees for external services, technical support.
