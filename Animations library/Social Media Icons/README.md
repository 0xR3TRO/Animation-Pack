## Project Description

### Goal:

The "Social Media Animations" project aims to provide users with a tool to create engaging and interactive animations for social media use. The application enables the design of unique animations that can be used in marketing campaigns, social media posts, and promotional materials.

### Features:

- **Animation Creation:** Users can create animations based on various templates and parameters, such as theme, style, and colors.
- **Customization:** Ability to adjust details of the animations to meet user expectations.
- **Library:** Store and browse previously created animations in a library.
- **Sharing:** Option to share created animations on social media platforms or download them to a local device.

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements:

- **Animation Creation:** Users can select creation parameters such as theme, animation style, and color palette.
- **Customization:** Access to tools for adjusting animation details like special effects, duration, and transitions.
- **Animation Library:** The application stores a history of created animations, with the ability to browse and reuse them.
- **Sharing:** Users can share their animations on various platforms or download them locally.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- **Aesthetic Quality:** The created animations should be visually appealing and meet social media standards.
- **Creation Speed:** Use efficient algorithms for instant results.
- **User Interface:** A user-friendly interface with intuitive customization tools.

## Interface Design

### Sketches/Visualizations:

- _Homepage:_ Control panel with options for creation, customization, and library access.
- _Creation Window:_ Area for selecting parameters and previewing the animation.
- _Animation Library:_ Browsing and managing previously created animations.

### Site Map:

- _Homepage_
  - Control Panel
  - Creation Options
  - Animation Library
- _Creation Window_
  - Creation Parameters
  - Animation Preview

  - List of Previously Created Animations
  - Sharing and Downloading Options

## System Architecture

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores data related to created animations, including:

- **Creation Parameters:** Information about the parameters chosen by the user.
- **Animations:** Stores created animations along with their details.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on a wrapped structure where:

- **Model:** Handles the logic of animation creation and management.
- **View:** Presents the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages communication between the model and the view.

## Implementation

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
- **Backend:** Flask (Python), TensorFlow (if needed for animation generation).
- **Database:** SQLite (for storing animation data).

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files_: Separate files for creation logic, interface, and data management.
- _Coding Style_: Use of modularity, readability, and comments in the code.

## Testing

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Check the correctness of creation and customization functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that components work together correctly.
- **User Interface Tests:** Check user interactions on various devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Evaluate animation creation performance based on different parameters.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each function of the application.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing identified bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, fixes, and publication on platforms available to users.
- **Timeline:** Set dates for planned stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establish communication channels for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on needs and user feedback.

## Schedule

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Divide work into specific tasks (e.g., implementing the generator, interface, testing).
- **Timeline:** Determine the time needed for each stage.

## Budget

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on working hours or development team.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, possible external service fees, technical support.
