## Project Description

### Goal:

The "3D Card Animations" project aims to provide users with a tool to create and implement three-dimensional animated cards on websites, particularly for product presentations, digital art, or marketing purposes. The application allows for easy generation and customization of 3D animated cards that captivate users' attention and enhance the website experience.

### Features Description:

- **3D Card Creation:** Users can create 3D cards with various animations and effects.
- **Customization:** Options to customize the appearance and animation effects of the cards.
- **CMS Integration:** Easy implementation of 3D cards in content management systems (CMS).
- **Sharing:** Option to embed the cards on websites and share them on social media platforms.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **3D Card Creation:** Users can select different card templates, animation effects, images, and texts.
- **Customization:** Access to tools for customizing the appearance of the cards, such as colors, textures, and motion effects.
- **CMS Integration:** The application should be compatible with popular CMS platforms (e.g., WordPress, Joomla).
- **Sharing:** Users can embed cards on their website or share them via links.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- **Animation Realism:** The card animations are expected to be smooth and aesthetically pleasing.
- **Loading Speed:** Optimization to ensure quick loading of the cards.
- **User Interface:** User-friendly interface with intuitive customization tools.

## Interface Design:

### Sketches/Visualizations:

- _Home Page:_ Control panel with options for creating, customizing, and viewing cards.
- _Card Creation Window:_ Area for selecting templates, adding images and texts, setting effects.
- _Card Gallery:_ Browse and manage created cards.

### Sitemap:

- _Home Page_
  - Control Panel
  - Card Creation Options
  - Card Gallery
- _Card Creation Window_
  - Template Selection
  - Appearance Customization
- _Card Gallery_
  - List of previously created cards
  - Embedding and sharing options

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores data related to the created cards, including:

- **Card Parameters:** Information on selected templates, images, texts, effects.
- **Cards:** Stores the created cards with their details and embedding options.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure:

- **Model:** Handles the logic for creating and managing cards.
- **View:** Presents the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages communication between the model and the view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js) for creating an interactive user interface.
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) for managing the application logic.
- **Database:** SQLite for storing card data.

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files_: Separate files for card creation logic, user interface, data management.
- _Coding Styles_: Use of modularity, readability, and comments in the code.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Testing:** Verify the correctness of card creation and customization functions.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure that components work together correctly.
- **User Interface Testing:** Test user interactions on various devices.
- **Performance Testing:** Assess the performance of card loading and animations.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each application feature.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing identified bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, bug fixing, publication on user-accessible platforms.
- **Timelines:** Set dates for planned stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establish communication channels for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on user needs and feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Divide work into specific tasks (e.g., card creation implementation, user interface, testing).
- **Timelines:** Determine the time needed for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on hours worked or development team.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, possible external service fees, technical support.
