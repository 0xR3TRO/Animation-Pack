## Project Description

### Objective:

The "Card Hover Blur" project aims to provide users with a feature that makes cards on a website blur when the cursor hovers over them. This tool is designed to be integrated as a ready-made solution in a CMS (Content Management System), allowing for easy implementation and customization.

### Features:

- **Card Blurring:** Cards on the webpage blur when the cursor hovers over them, enhancing visual appeal.
- **Customization:** Users can adjust the blur intensity, background colors, and content of the cards.
- **Easy Integration:** Seamless addition to popular CMS platforms like WordPress or Joomla.
- **Responsiveness:** Cards are responsive and display correctly on various devices.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Blur Effect:** Users can specify the intensity and type of blur applied to the cards on hover.
- **Card Customization:** Options for editing card content, including text, images, links, and background colors.
- **CMS Integration:** Simple addition of the feature to existing pages through a module or plugin.
- **Responsiveness:** Cards should adjust to screen resolution, providing optimal display on both mobile and desktop devices.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- **Aesthetics:** The blur effect and card appearance should be visually appealing.
- **Performance:** The blur effect should operate smoothly without delays.
- **User-Friendliness:** An intuitive interface for editing and customizing the cards.

## Interface Design:

### Sketches/Visuals:

- _Homepage:_ View of cards that blur when hovered over.
- _Customization Panel:_ Interface for adjusting blur settings, card content, and background colors.
- _Responsiveness Preview:_ Option to see how cards will look on different devices.

### Site Map:

- _Homepage_
  - List of cards
- _Customization Panel_
  - Blur settings
  - Card content editing
  - Responsiveness preview

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure:

The application stores card data, including:

- **Card Content:** Texts, images, links.
- **Blur Settings:** Intensity and type of blur effect.
- **Customization Settings:** Background colors, card sizes, and other style settings.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on a layered structure:

- **Model:** Manages card data and blur settings.
- **View:** Displays the user interface for editing and customization.
- **Controller:** Handles interactions between the model and the view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
- **Backend:** Node.js (if needed for more complex server operations).
- **Database:** SQLite (if required for storing card settings and content history).

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Separate files for blur logic, interface, and data management.
- _Code Style:_ Emphasis on modularity, readability, and commenting.

## Testing:

### Testing Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Verify the correctness of blur and customization functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure the module integrates properly with different CMS platforms.
- **User Interface Tests:** Check interactions on various devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Evaluate the blur effect performance across different browsers.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop test cases for each application feature.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing issues.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, bug fixes, and publishing the module/plugin for CMS.
- **Timelines:** Define dates for each stage of the project.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Set up communication channels for user feedback and issue reporting.
- **Updates:** Plan for regular updates based on user needs and feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Development Stages:** Breakdown of tasks such as implementing the blur effect, interface design, and testing.
- **Deadlines:** Set timeframes for each development stage.

## Cost Estimate:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Development Costs:** Based on hours worked or the development team's fees.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Server costs, potential external service fees, and technical support.
