## Project Description

### Goal:

The "Animated Input" project aims to provide users with a tool for adding interactive and animated form elements to websites, which can be easily implemented as a ready-made solution within a CMS model. The application enhances user experience with dynamic animation effects during data entry in forms.

### Features Description:

- **Animated Form Fields:** Users can add animations to various form elements such as text fields, buttons, checkboxes, etc.
- **Animation Customization:** Ability to customize animation styles and effects, including transitions, color changes, scaling, etc.
- **Predefined Templates:** Ready-to-use animation templates that can be easily implemented and customized.
- **CMS Integration:** Easy integration with popular content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Adding Animations:** Users can select and add animations to various form elements.
- **Customization:** Users have access to tools for customizing animations, including changing effects, speed, and colors.
- **Predefined Templates:** The application includes a set of predefined animation templates that can be easily implemented and edited.
- **CMS Integration:** Easy integration with popular CMS for quick deployment on websites.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- **Animation Smoothness:** Animations must run smoothly without delays.
- **Ease of Use:** The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Responsiveness:** Animated elements must be responsive and work correctly on various devices and screen resolutions.

## Interface Design:

### Interface Sketches/Visualizations:

- _Home Page:_ Control panel with options for adding and customizing animations.
- _Customization Window:_ Area for selecting and customizing animation effects.
- _Template Gallery:_ Browsing and selecting predefined animation templates.

### Site Map:

- _Home Page_
  - Control Panel
  - Animation Options
  - Template Gallery
- _Customization Window_
  - Effect Selection
  - Animation Parameter Customization
- _Template Gallery_
  - List of Available Templates
  - Preview and Implementation Option

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores data related to animations, including:

- **Animation Parameters:** Information about selected effects and their settings.
- **Templates:** Predefined animation templates with editing capabilities.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on the MVC model:

- **Model:** Manages the logic of animations and data storage.
- **View:** Handles the presentation of the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages user interactions and communication between the model and view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js for dynamic effects).
- **Backend:** Node.js (for managing data and CMS integration).
- **Database:** MongoDB (storing data about animations and templates).

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Separate files for animation logic, user interface, and data management.
- _Coding Styles:_ Modularity, readability, and commenting in the code.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Check the correctness of animation addition and customization functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure components work together correctly and that CMS integration is seamless.
- **User Interface Tests:** Test user interactions on different devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Assess animation smoothness and interface responsiveness.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each application function.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing identified issues.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, bug fixes, publishing as a plugin for various CMS.
- **Timeline:** Define dates for planned deployment stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Communication channels for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Regular updates based on needs and user feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Divide work into specific tasks (e.g., animation implementation, CMS integration, testing).
- **Timeline:** Define the time required for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on hours worked by the development team.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, external service fees, technical support.
