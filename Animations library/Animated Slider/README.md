## Project Description

### Goal:

The "Animated Slider" project aims to provide users with a tool for easily creating and managing dynamic, animated sliders that can be integrated with various content management systems (CMS). The application allows for the creation of visually appealing content presentations that can be used on websites to enhance user experience and increase engagement.

### Feature Description:

- **Slider Creation:** Users can create animated sliders by choosing from different templates, transition effects, and animation parameters.
- **Customization:** Ability to personalize the content and styles of each slide, including texts, images, colors, and animations.
- **Slider Management:** Store, view, and edit created sliders in an intuitive management panel.
- **CMS Integration:** Easy integration of sliders with popular content management systems (e.g., WordPress, Joomla).

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Slider Creation:** Users can select templates, transition effects, and animations for each slide.
- **Customization:** Access to tools for customizing slide content, such as adding text, images, changing colors, and styles.
- **Slider Management:** The application allows managing created sliders in the admin panel, with options to edit and delete them.
- **CMS Integration:** Sliders can be easily added to a website via a plugin or embed code.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- **Interactivity and Responsiveness:** The slider should be interactive and responsive, adapting to different screen resolutions.
- **Performance:** The slider should operate smoothly, with no lag in animations.
- **Ease of Use:** An intuitive user interface enabling easy creation and management of sliders without requiring advanced technical knowledge.

## Interface Design:

### Sketches/Visualizations of the Interface:

- _Home Page:_ A control panel with options to create a new slider, manage existing ones, and access settings.
- _Slider Editing Window:_ A space for adding and editing slides, with customization options for each element.
- _Slider Management Panel:_ Viewing and managing previously created sliders.

### Site Map:

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores slider data, including:

- **Slider Parameters:** Information about the user's selected templates, transition effects, and animations.
- **Slide Content:** Stores texts, images, and other elements added to the slides.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on the MVC model, where:

- **Model:** Responsible for the logic of creating and managing sliders.
- **View:** Presents the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages communication between the model and the view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express) or Flask (Python) - for managing data and generating sliders.
- **Database:** MongoDB or SQLite - for storing slider data.

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Separate files for slider management logic, user interface, and data handling.
- _Coding Styles:_ Modularity, readability, and comments in the code.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Verify the correctness of slider creation and customization functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure all components work together correctly.
- **User Interface Tests:** Test user interactions on various devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Evaluate slider performance under different conditions.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each application function.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing identified bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, fixes, publishing as a plugin for popular CMSs.
- **Timeline:** Define dates for planned deployment stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establish communication channels for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on user feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Breakdown tasks into specific activities (e.g., implementing slider creation, interface, testing).
- **Timeline:** Define the time required for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on hours worked or developer team.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, technical support, updates.
