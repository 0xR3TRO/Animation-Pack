## Project Description

### Objective:

The "Sliding Card" project aims to provide users with an elegant and functional solution for presenting content on websites in the form of sliding cards. This application, which can be implemented as a ready-made solution in a CMS model, allows users to create and manage cards containing text, images, and other media.

### Features:

- **Card Creation:** Users can create cards containing various types of content.
- **Customization:** Users can customize the appearance of the cards, including colors, fonts, and background images.
- **Navigation:** Users can slide cards horizontally or vertically to view the content.
- **CMS Integration:** Easy integration with popular Content Management Systems (CMS).

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Card Creation:** Users can add text, images, links, and other media to cards.
- **Customization:** Users can change the appearance of the cards, including colors, fonts, and background images.
- **Navigation:** The ability to slide cards horizontally or vertically.
- **CMS Integration:** Compatibility with systems like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- **Responsiveness:** The application should work correctly on various devices and screen resolutions.
- **Performance:** Smooth browsing and sliding of cards without delays.
- **Ease of Integration:** Intuitive installation and configuration process in CMS systems.

## Interface Design:

### Sketches/Visualizations:

- _Home Page:_ Includes a panel for creating and editing cards, as well as a preview of the sliding cards.
- _Card Editing Window:_ A place to add and edit card content and customize their appearance.

### Sitemap:

- _Home Page_

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores card data, including:

- **Card Content:** Text, images, links, and other media added by the user.
- **Appearance Settings:** Information about user-selected colors, fonts, and background images.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model:

- **Model:** Responsible for logic and data management of cards and their settings.
- **View:** Presents the user interface and card previews.
- **Controller:** Manages communication between the model and the view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) for the API, SQLite database for storing card data.

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Separate files for card management logic, user interface, and API.
- _Code Style:_ Modular code, readability, and explanatory comments.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Verify the correctness of card creation and editing functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure all components work together correctly.
- **User Interface Tests:** Check that the interface works correctly on different devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Assess the smoothness of card sliding and overall application performance.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each application function.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing found bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, fixes, and publication as a plugin or module for CMS.
- **Timeline:** Set dates for planned stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establish communication channels for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on user needs and feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Break down tasks into specific steps (e.g., implementing card creation features, interface, testing).
- **Timeline:** Estimate the time needed for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Costs related to the development hours of the programming team.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, possible fees for external services, technical support.
