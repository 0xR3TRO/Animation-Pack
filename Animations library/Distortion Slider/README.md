## Project Description

### Goal:

The "Distortion Slider" project aims to create a component that allows users to dynamically manipulate images by adjusting a slider that introduces distortion effects. This component can be integrated with various Content Management Systems (CMS) to enhance the functionality of websites, enabling interactive editing and visual effects.

### Features:

- **Distortion Slider:** Users can adjust the level of distortion applied to the image using a slider.
- **Live Preview:** Distortion effects are visible in real-time, allowing for precise adjustments.
- **Customization:** Ability to set initial parameters for the slider and distortion effects.
- **CMS Integration:** The component is designed for easy integration with popular CMS platforms.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Distortion Slider:** Allows users to regulate the intensity of the distortion effect.
- **Live Preview:** Immediate updating of the image based on the slider value.
- **Customization:** Setting default values and range for the slider.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- **Effect Realism:** Distortion effects must be aesthetically pleasing and realistic.
- **Performance:** The component should operate smoothly without noticeable delays.
- **User Interface:** Intuitive and easy-to-use interface, adhering to UX principles.

## Interface Design:

### Sketches/Visualizations of the Interface:

- _Slider Panel:_ Control panel with a slider for adjusting the distortion level.
- _Preview Area:_ Display area showing the image with the applied distortion effect.

### Site Map:

- _Slider Panel_
  - Distortion Slider
  - Initial Settings
- _Preview Area_
  - Live view of the distortion effect

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The component manages the following data:

- **Slider Settings:** Stores slider values and distortion parameters.
- **Image:** Stores the original image and its distorted version.

### Architecture Diagrams:

- **Model:** Handles the logic for image distortion.
- **View:** Presents the user interface and image preview.
- **Controller:** Manages interactions between the model and the view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or vanilla JavaScript for simplicity).
- **Backend:** No backend requirements â€“ the component operates client-side.
- **Libraries:** Canvas API for image manipulation.

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Separate files for slider logic, image manipulation, and interface.
- _Coding Style:_ Modular design, readability, with comments.

## Testing:

### Testing Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Verify the functionality of the slider and distortion effects.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure the component works correctly across different CMS platforms.
- **User Interface Tests:** Check responsiveness and usability on various devices.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop test cases for slider functionality and preview.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing issues.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** CMS integration, testing, publishing.
- **Timelines:** Set dates for each stage of the process.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Channels for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Regular updates based on user feedback and needs.

## Timeline:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Slider implementation, CMS integration, testing, deployment.
- **Timelines:** Define the time required for each stage.

## Cost Estimate:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Development Costs:** Based on work hours or developer team.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Server costs, potential external services, technical support.
