## Project Description

### Goal:

The "Hover Effect on Siblings" project aims to provide users with a solution for adding interactive hover effects to sibling elements on web pages created using a CMS model. The application allows for easy implementation of visual effects that can enhance the attractiveness and interactivity of websites.

### Features Description:

- **Hover Effects:** Users can configure effects that are activated when hovering over an element.
- **Customization:** Ability to adjust effect details such as colors, animations, delays, etc.
- **Live Preview:** A tool for previewing effects in real-time before applying them to the site.
- **CMS Integration:** Easy integration with popular content management systems (CMS) like WordPress or Joomla.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Hover Effects:** Ability to select and configure various hover effects, such as color changes, scaling, or shifting.
- **Customization:** Tools to adjust effect parameters, such as animation duration, colors, and other details.
- **Live Preview:** Option to preview effects before applying them, so the user can see how they will look on the site.
- **CMS Integration:** Plugin or module compatible with popular CMSs, allowing easy implementation of effects.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- **Responsiveness:** Effects should work correctly on different devices and browsers.
- **Performance:** Effects should be smooth and not cause delays in page loading.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive user interface for easy effect configuration.

## Interface Design:

### Interface Sketches/Visualizations:

- _Configuration Panel:_ Tools for selecting and customizing hover effects.
- _Live Preview:_ Section where the user can see a preview of the selected effect.
- _CMS Integration:_ Section with instructions and tools for integration with the chosen CMS.

### Site Map:

- _Configuration Panel_
  - Effect selection options
  - Effect parameter customization
- _Live Preview_
  - Preview section
- _CMS Integration_
  - Instructions
  - Integration tools

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores data about hover effect configurations, including:

- **Effect Parameters:** Contains information about the effects and their settings chosen by the user.
- **CSS Styles:** Stores the generated CSS styles for the effects.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model, where:

- **Model:** Manages logic and configuration data for effects.
- **View:** Presents the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages interactions between the model and the view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express) for managing data and configurations.
- **CMS Integration:** Plugins/modules for WordPress, Joomla, and other popular CMSs.

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Separate files for effect configuration, interaction logic, and CMS integration.
- _Coding Style:_ Modularity, code readability, with comments and documentation.

## Testing:

### Testing Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Checking the correctness of functions for configuring and customizing effects.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensuring effects are correctly implemented and work on CMS pages.
- **User Interface Tests:** Checking the intuitiveness and functionality of the interface on different devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Evaluating the smoothness and speed of effects.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each application function.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing found bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, fixing, publishing plugins/modules on CMS platforms.
- **Deadlines:** Setting dates for planned deployment stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establishing communication channels with users for reporting issues.
- **Updates:** Planning regular updates based on user feedback and technological developments.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Division of work into specific tasks (e.g., implementation of effects, interface, testing, CMS integration).
- **Deadlines:** Specifying the time needed for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on hours worked by the development team.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, potential external service fees, technical support.
