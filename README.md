## Project Description

### Goal:

The "Animation Pack" project aims to create a GitHub repository that stores all animations specifically designed for implementation on other websites. The repository will contain a collection of many smaller animation projects, bundled into one easy-to-use and implement package. All animations will be categorized and tailored to allow users to quickly find and deploy the desired animation effects.

### Features Description:

- **Categorization of animations:** Animations will be divided into categories such as entry, exit, transitions, etc., to facilitate browsing.
- **Ease of implementation:** Each animation will come with ready-to-use code for easy implementation on other websites.
- **Customization:** Ability to adjust animation parameters such as duration, delay, iterations, etc.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation describing each animation and how to implement it.
- **Examples:** Examples of animations in various contexts to demonstrate their practical use.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Categorization of animations:** The repository must contain a well-organized structure of animation categories.
- **Ease of implementation:** Each animation must come with implementation instructions and sample code.
- **Customization:** Users must be able to customize animation parameters.
- **Documentation:** Each animation must be thoroughly documented, including methods for modification and implementation.
- **Examples:** The repository must include examples of animations in use.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- **Code readability:** The animation code must be clear and well-documented.
- **Usability:** Animations must be easy to implement and modify.
- **Performance:** Animations must be optimized for performance to avoid slowing down websites.
- **Compatibility:** Animations must be compatible with different browsers and devices.

## Interface Design:

### Sketches/Interface Visualizations:

- _Home Page:_ Overview of animation categories and available projects.
- _Category Page:_ List of animations in the selected category with a brief description of each.
- _Animation Page:_ Detailed description of the animation, implementation code, customization parameters, and usage examples.

### Site Map:

- _Home Page_
  - Overview of animation categories
  - Animation search
- _Category Page_
  - List of animations in the selected category
  - Brief descriptions of animations
- _Animation Page_
  - Detailed description of the animation
  - Implementation code
  - Customization parameters
  - Usage examples

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The repository stores data related to animations, including:

- **Animation categories:** Information about different animation categories.
- **Animations:** Details about each animation, such as code, customization parameters, usage examples.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The repository's architecture is based on a wrapped structure, where:

- **Model:** Responsible for the logic of storing and organizing animations.
- **View:** Presents the user interface, including documentation and animation examples.
- **Controller:** Manages communication between the model and the view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Backend:** None - the GitHub repository does not require a backend.
- **Database:** None - information is stored directly in repository files.

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files:_ Separate files for each animation, organized into directories by category.
- _Coding Styles:_ Use of modularity, readability, and comments in the code.

## Testing:

### Testing Plan:

- **Unit tests:** Check the correctness of animation code.
- **Integration tests:** Ensure that animations work correctly together in different contexts.
- **User interface tests:** Check if the documentation and examples are clear and useful.
- **Performance tests:** Evaluate the performance of animations with different parameters.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each animation.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing found bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment stages:** Testing, fixes, publication on GitHub.
- **Deadlines:** Define planned stage dates.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical support:** Establish communication channels for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on user needs and feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Stages of implementation:** Divide work into specific tasks (e.g., creating animation categories, writing documentation, testing).
- **Deadlines:** Determine the time required for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Development:** Based on working hours or the development team.
- **Maintenance costs:** Hosting on GitHub, possible fees for external services, technical support.
